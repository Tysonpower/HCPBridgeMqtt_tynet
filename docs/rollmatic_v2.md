## Troubleshooting Error "04"
HÃ¶rmann RollMatic v2 uses HCP2-Bus which requires external modules to be registered and unregistered via bus scan. Error "04" shows up when you want to drive the door, but the registered external module was removed without performing a bus scan afterwards. The door will not drive until the issue is solved.

This can be achieved by powering off the door, re-attaching the external module and powering it on again. Or by performing a complete factory reset of the RollMatic v2.

Unfortunately, a simple un-registration of a registered (but non-working or non-attached module) seems not possible since in my case, Error "04" prevents access to the programming menu after powering on.
